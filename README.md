Benchmark Test
==============

This project is meant to run several tests against several template engines in order to compare them in terms of performance.

That way will be really simple to run a benchmark test on your own machine.

Template Engines Used
===

- Jtwig
- Freemarker
- Velocity
- JSP/JSLT

How to run them?
===

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the ./run-tests.sh script and wait...
3. Send the results to me (it would be nice)
